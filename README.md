# Hello there! :wave:

### Bio:

Welcome to the README for my personal GitHub page. I am a US Navy veteran of 8 years, where I served as a Mass Communication Specialist and 
a Master-at-Arms. Once I decided to transition out of the military, I attended an 18-week software engineering bootcamp as part of the DoD 
Skillbridge program and really ignited a passion for programming and building things with code. After the bootcamp, I decided to pursue 
a degree in Computer Science, completing my associate's degree at Tidewater Community College in December of 2025. After Tidewater, I transferred
to Old Dominion University where I am working towards my bachelor's degree with an expected graduation in Spring 2027 (*Go Monarchs!*). Although 
I'm open to working almost anywhere in the industry, my ideal career would either be to continue my service working with the federal government 
or possibly in the gaming industry (as I am an avid RPG gamer, anything from video games to tabletop).
